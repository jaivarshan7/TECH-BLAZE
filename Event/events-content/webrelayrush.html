            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> Paper-Based Objective Test</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this round, teams will be given shuffle-based puzzles where important web development concepts, steps, or code snippets are mixed up. 
            The task is to rearrange or match them in the correct order within the given time.
This round does not require coding on a computer. 
Instead, it focuses on understanding how frontend, backend, and database work together and checks the team’s logical thinking and conceptual clarity.
Only teams with a strong foundation and quick thinking will move on to the next round.</p>

            <li><strong>Tools Allowed:</strong> vs code IDE</li>

        <p>Each team will be shown a completed website template (HTML and CSS). 
            The goal is to enhance, fix, and complete the user interface based on the given instructions.
Only one team member can code at a time, and each participant will be given a specific time limit. 
Once the time is over, the next member must continue the work from where the previous person stopped — without discussion during the switch.
This round focuses on design skills, code flow, and teamwork, preparing teams for backend integration in the final round.</p>
